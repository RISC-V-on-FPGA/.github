# RISC-V-on-FPGA

Embedded systems has seen remarkable advancements over the years, with processor design playing a substantial
part of this progress, namely reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processors such as ARM and MIPS. An
upcoming development in the last couple of years has been the emergence of the RISC-V instruction set architecture
(ISA). RISC-V stands out from previous architectures with its open-source nature, scalability and flexibility, making
it a promising choice for future implementations in embedded systems.

Within the realm of RISC-V architecture, the implementation of custom processors presents an exciting opportunity
for exploration and innovation. By designing and developing a RISC-V processor from scratch, we delve into the
complexities of computer architecture, instruction sets, and hardware implementation.

Despite the growing popularity of RISC-V, there exists a lack in hands-on experiences for students interested in
processor design. Many traditional courses focus on theoretical aspects of computer architecture without providing
students with the opportunity to engage in hands-on hardware design projects. Our project aims to address this
gap by providing a comprehensive learning experience centered around the development of a RISC-V processor
prototype.

The primary objective of our project is to design and implement a RISC-V processor for FPGA and ASIC using
SystemVerilog. We will follow a systematic approach, starting from a basic 5 stage pipeline and gradually increasing
the number of supported instructions in our design through iterative stages of simulation, synthesis, and physical
implementation on FPGA and ASIC platforms.
